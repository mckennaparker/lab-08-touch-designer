# Creating a Slit-Scan Effect Using TouchDesigner Texture Operators
Created a slit-scan effect in TouchDesigner by first making a video input into a 3D texture. I then created the input for the effect with a ramp node into a limit node. I also used a displacement node with noise as the first input and the limit node as the second input, which was added as the second input to a time machine node. The time machine node ouput was the input for the final out node. The video below shows a demo of the output, and the link below that is to the tutorial I used, made by Clara Nolan, a TA for Procedural Computer Graphics at Penn.
